### Getting Started

1. Please download/clone this folder/repo, and start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.
   I used [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en). 
   The port is default to 8950 and the web server URL is default to `http://127.0.0.1`.
   The above information can be changed in dbhelper.js file. 

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://127.0.0.1:8950` or please click the server link on [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en) will work too.
3. The application is running and please feel free to use the feature.
